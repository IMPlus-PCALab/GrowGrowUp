Some experiences for new researchers (major in deep learning) to grow grow up

### Fresh Village
We highly suggest you to master basic usage of [linux](), [git](), [tmux](), [vscode](). 

> * **linux**: basic linux commands are used for communicating with your GPU/CPU servers;
> * **git**: git is used for maintaining your reserach codes and collaborating/sharing with others;
> * **tmux**: tmux is designed for running experiments backstage;
> * **vscode**: vscode is a wonderful tool to debug/write your deep learning projects!
